# Interview Flow

Experimenting with the most comfortable flow to interviewing. My goal with every interview is to learn something new about technology (design, best practices, tools, software, etc)

My current recommendation is:

## Quick Overview of the Hour

Describing this structure to the candidate so they know what to expect

## Introductions

I explain who I am which is not all that interesting but helps to improve transparency

## IceBreaker

Typically a question about the candidates experience with previous projects or open source tools.

## Technical Question 1

Depending on the role and my assigned responsibilities to during the interview, these questions will vary.

## Technical Question 2

""

## Technical Question 3

""

## Open Source Project Favorites

Bonus: we talk about any open source project the candidate is interested in

## Closing Candidate Questions

I try and leave, roughly, 10 minutes for this section.

Done!
